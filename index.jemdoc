== About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate at [www.nyu.edu New York University], working with my supervisor [https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/zhong-ping-jiang Prof. Zhong-ping Jiang]. I received my Master's degree in Automation from [http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/ Shanghai Jiao Tong University], Shanghai, China, where I was advised by [http://www.automation.sjtu.edu.cn/wdzhang/ Prof. Weidong Zhang]. Before that, I received my B.S. degree in Automation from [https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/ Beihang University].

My research focuses on decision making under uncertainty, includes but not limited to reinforcement learning, adaptive/approximate dynamic programming, optimal control, stochastic control, model predictive control.
